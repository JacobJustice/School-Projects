# School-Projects

repository contains a dump of school projects I've made for extra credit or assignments (with a degree of creativity) that I was proud of


# Hackathon projects

hackathon projects I worked on that I don't host the repo for. All of these were made in under 24 hours.

https://github.com/sippejw/EasyCite : Allows you to easily make in text citations in a google doc from physical media

https://github.com/sippejw/BarHelper : Measures the volume of liquid in a bottle from a raster image

https://github.com/sippejw/IBM-Waldon : a web scraping bot that searches wikipedia for answers to HQ Trivia questions

https://github.com/aThorp96/ChadBotX : A hardware project that requires an NES and NES controller, takes pre-recorded inputs and plays them back on a real console
